# Code Snippets/Boilerplates/Custom Wordpress code
- Repo to store various code snippets for reuse and backup

## Blur_Effect
- HTML and CSS to achieve a clear background with a rectangle on top that blurs the background image only within the rectangle.
- Originally built within a Wordpress site
- explanations to be added soon, however, I need to remember how everything works again... 0_o

## h_and_t_custom_code
- psi_scripts.js - two custom functions that accomplish the following:
  1 - Moves product description in woocommerce to just below the add-to-cart button to allow customers to read more about the product before needing to scroll to the bottom of the page.
  2 - When working in Wordpress and you have two text blocks with class 'psi_flip_box_front' and 'psi_flip_box_back' respectively contained within a 'psi_flip_wrapper' container, this code will allow a fade in and fade out functionality that is currently unavailable within Wordpress itself. I believe the closest thing to this is a rotating functionality, however, on smaller screens and mobile, the rotating functionality gets quite hectic and quickly becomes a crutch for the site rather than a boon.
- 404.php - a temporary 404 page for a website. Very basic functionality, but would be easier to just clone from here if another website needed a 404 page.

## we_custom_code
- Working on this as functionality is needed on the company site.
